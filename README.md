# Crypto4AI
Paper and tool list about AI for Crypto and Crypto for AI.

Crypto or blockchain, has already proven that some computation tasks could be completed in a decentralized manner. But is it possible for these decentralized infrastructures to handle more costly computation tasks like AI inference, fine-tuning, or even training?

Of course, it could be! In this repo, we collect the related state-of-the-art papers and tools.
